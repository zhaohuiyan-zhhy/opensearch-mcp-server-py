## OpenSearch MCP Server

**opensearch-mcp-server-py** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSearch that enables AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch clusters. It provides a standardized interface for AI models to perform operations like searching indices, retrieving mappings, and managing shards through both stdio and streaming (SSE/Streamable HTTP) protocols.

**Key features:**

- Seamless integration with AI assistants and LLMs through the MCP protocol
- Support for both stdio and streaming server transports (SSE and Streamable HTTP)
- Built-in tools for common OpenSearch operations
- Dynamic per-call connection parameters for targeting different clusters without server reconfiguration
- Easy integration with Claude Desktop and LangChain
- Secure authentication using basic auth, IAM roles, header-based auth, and OpenSearch mTLS

For detailed setup, including Kubernetes deployment and mTLS configuration, see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

## Installing opensearch-mcp-server-py

Opensearch-mcp-server-py can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opensearch-mcp-server-py/) via pip:

```
pip install opensearch-mcp-server-py
```

### Zero-Config Setup

The server can be started with no environment variables at all. Agents provide connection details dynamically on each tool call:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-mcp-server-py"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this setup, agents pass `opensearch_url` and authentication parameters directly when calling any tool. This is useful when agents discover endpoints from a knowledge base, runbook, or SOP, or when a single agent needs to work with multiple clusters in one session. See [Dynamic Connection Parameters](USER_GUIDE.md#dynamic-connection-parameters) for details.

## Available Tools

By default, only **core tools** are enabled to provide essential OpenSearch functionality:

See [Agentic Memory Usage](USER_GUIDE.md#agentic-memory-usage) in the User Guide for setup instructions.

**Note:** Container creation is an infrastructure setup operation that requires careful configuration of embedding models, LLM connectors, strategies, and index settings.
